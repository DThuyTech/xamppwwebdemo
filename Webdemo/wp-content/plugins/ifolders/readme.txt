###üìã FOLDER PERMISSIONS
One of the main features of the plugin is the ability to assign permissions to user groups. Group users can manage and organize folders together, either separately from each other or mixed. Create a group, add users to it, define permissions that the user can view, add, edit, delete and assign folders.
